# 🚘 Touareg MH2p Full-Screen CarPlay Mod

This repository provides the **`viewhandler.zip`** and **`install.sh`** files extracted from my **right-hand-drive Volkswagen Touareg** for use with the [MH2p SD Modkit](https://lawpaul.github.io/MH2p_SD_ModKit_Site/).

It enables **full-screen Apple CarPlay and Android Auto** on MH2p head units.

For full details and community discussion, check the dedicated Club Touareg thread:

Special thanks to **DrewB** for extracting `viewhandler.zip` and for the encouragement along the way 🙌
